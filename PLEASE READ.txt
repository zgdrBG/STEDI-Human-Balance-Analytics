1. Please note that due to some issues with filtering customer_landing_to_trusted, I have used the output tables (tool in Glue Studio: AWS Glue Data Catalog) rather than each time loading data from my S3 bucket (tool in Glue Studio: Amazon S3). The same issue with filtering only customer records who agreed to share their data for research purposes has happened to other students as well, e.g. as noted here (https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/1035011).

2. Please note that machine_learning_curated.py is not in the final subsimission and SQL was used directly in Athena to achieve the same result. When creating step_trainer_trusted in Glue Studio, no results were provided in the output table, hence SQL was necessary to be used. Once again this issue is not isolated for me, as other students have experience that as well.
